# megabase_index_incrementer
This is a Rust application to easily catalog Factorio megabases posted around the web. Existing categorized megabases can be found within the megabases.json file.

This application gathers a megabase post link, and a path to the downloaded file on your local system, to automatically collect a sha256 hash and (if Factorio is installed) the Factorio version the megabase was saved with.
